# Smart Recipe Generator - Technical Approach

## Overview
The Smart Recipe Generator is a React-based web application that intelligently matches user ingredients with recipes using a sophisticated algorithm and comprehensive database.

## Core Algorithm
**Ingredient Matching Logic**: The application uses fuzzy string matching to compare user-selected ingredients with recipe ingredients. The algorithm calculates match percentages and prioritizes recipes where users have all required ingredients. This ensures relevant suggestions while providing flexibility for partial matches.

**Recipe Database Design**: Built a comprehensive database of 20+ diverse recipes across multiple cuisines, each containing detailed metadata including cooking time, difficulty, nutritional information, and dietary tags. This enables precise filtering and matching.

## Technical Implementation
**React Architecture**: Utilized functional components with hooks for state management, ensuring clean, maintainable code. Implemented useCallback for performance optimization and proper dependency management.

**User Experience**: Created an intuitive interface with real-time ingredient suggestions, comprehensive filtering options, and detailed recipe modals. Added loading states, error handling, and persistent storage for user preferences.

**Responsive Design**: Implemented mobile-first responsive design with modern CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts, ensuring optimal experience across all devices.
